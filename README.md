This Project's currently planned features:

    1. (Complete) Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs 
    2. (Complete) Create the divs using JavaScript
    3. (Complete) Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. 
    4. (Complete) Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you’ve got a new sketch pad. 
    5. Instead of just changing the color of your grid from black to white (for example) have each pass through it with the mouse change to a completely random RGB value. 
    6. Adjust the brightness of colors allowing pastels.
    7.  Aloow user to manually select color, without changing the color of already marked cells.
    8.  Allow user to manually adjust opacity.
    6. Push your project to GitHub!
